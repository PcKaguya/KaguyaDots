# 90-kde.conf - environment overrides to improve KDE/Qt theming & desktop detection
# Place this file in ~/.config/environment.d/ so systemd user sessions pick it up.
# Notes:
# - `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct` makes Qt apps read qt5ct/qt6ct settings (if installed).
# - `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` includes 'KDE' so desktop files that restrict themselves to KDE are visible.
# - If Dolphin is a Flatpak, the sandbox may limit visible apps; ensure xdg-desktop-portal & portal backends are installed.
