# Minimal kdeglobals to prefer Breeze Dark color scheme for KDE/Qt apps.
# Drop this file in ~/.config/kdeglobals to hint KDE applications to use
# the Breeze dark color scheme and Breeze icons in non-Plasma sessions.
#
# Notes:
# - Make sure the 'Breeze' icon theme and 'Breeze Dark' color scheme are installed on your system.
# - For Qt apps to pick up KDE-style theming outside of Plasma, also set the Qt platform theme
#   (e.g. via QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct/qt6ct) or include KDE in XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP.
#   See ~/.config/environment.d/90-kde.conf in this repo for an example.
